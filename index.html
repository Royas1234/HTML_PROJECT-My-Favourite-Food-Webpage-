                                    <p>Ofada rice is a Yoruba dish. It is the name for an indigenous rice from a small community called Ofada in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. It is not exclusively grown in the community, but it is an indigenous rice grown in southwest Nigeria but named after the Ofada community. It is used in making a variety of dishes. Ofada rice are mostly blends, and some of the rice varieties in the blends are not indigenous to Africa; however, they usually also contain African rice. It is grown almost exclusively in Ogun State,a state in southwestern Nigeria. 
                                    Ofada rice is traditionally served in an uma leaf , with a sauce of atarodo (spicy) and tatase (sweet) pepper, onion, locust beans, palm oil, and meat. It is a festive meal rather than an everyday type of food for most Nigerians but it is an everyday street food for the towns of Ikenne and Ilisan in Ogun state.It is also often served along with a vegetable stew that may contain locust beans as an ingredient.It is often served with ayamase stew or obe-ata-iru, both specially prepared for ofada rice consumption.</p>
